description,"A network of associations among suspects, victims, and/or witnesses involved in crimes in St. Louis in the 1990s. Data are derived from police records, via snowball sampling from five initial homicides. Left nodes are people, right nodes are crime events, and edges connect people to particular crimes events they were associated with. Metadata includes names, genders, and roles (suspects, victims, and/or witnesses)."

long-description: This bipartite network contains persons who appeared in at least one crime case as either a suspect, a victim, a witness or both a suspect and victim at the same time. A left node represents a person and a right node represents a crime. An edge between two nodes shows that the left node was involved in the crime represented by the right node.
